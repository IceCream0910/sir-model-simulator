## Simple SIR Model Simulation
This project tries to reproduce a simplified [SIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model "SIR Model Wikipedia") for spread of diseases using canvas and the JavaScript [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. Some scripts were minified with Google's [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler).
## Final Result
The final result can be found at https://lorenzofelletti.github.io/sirsimx/.
